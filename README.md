# Self-Driving Experiments

## Why?

Everyone else seems to be working on self-driving vehicles at the moment, so I wanted to get in on the fun.

## Is the construction, etc documented anywhere?

Yes.  You can follow the progress, and even offer comments and suggestions at

## What is your car?

I am using a kid's ride-on electric car as a platform because I already have it.  This means I have to rework the steering mechanism (which is woefully simple) but that is just one more obstacle to solve.

The car itself uses a six-volt battery and electric motor to drive a single rear wheel.  While this doesn't sound impressive, with nobody on-board, the performance and battery life should be quite acceptable.  Also, it's big and looks like a proper car.

## What is the compute platform?

Still up in the air at present.  I am starting out with a Raspberry Pi because I have some spare units, but if this doesn't prove sufficiently powerful, I may switch it out for an ODroid XU4, which I also have available.

In terms of the electronic interfaces for motors and the like, I will be making every effort to use off-the-shelf components.

## Is this a fork of someone else's project?

No.  I realise lots of people have done great stuff already, but I learn more by making my own mistakes.

Of course if it all falls in a heap, I reserve the right to remove the above statement...

## Can I help?

Yes of course.  The more the merrier.

## Can you tell me how to adapt a brand X ride-on car to your software?

Umm... I doubt it.  I will have enough trouble with my own, but I intend to document my progress, so hopefully that will help you.

## Should I put my son/daughter/pet/spouse into the car when it's done?

Are you serious?  While I can't actually *stop* you doing that, I strongly advise against doing so!
